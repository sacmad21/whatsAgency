### WhatsApp Communication Workflow Design with Advanced Enhancements

# Workflow Definitions

### 1. Property Availability Query Workflow
- **Trigger**: User sends a message like "Is a 2-bedroom apartment available?"
- **Steps**:
  1. Webhook receives the message.
  2. Use **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with GROQ-based APIs to fetch property details from the database.
     - Query embeddings can be used to match user intent against property listings.
  3. Call GenAI models to generate a natural and engaging response based on query results.
  4. Use function-calling to fetch additional details (e.g., agent contact or neighborhood stats) as needed.
  5. **Response**:
     - If properties are available:
       - Send property details in text format or as a carousel.
     - If none are available:
       - Use generative AI to suggest alternative options with Quick Reply buttons (e.g., "Search other areas", "Adjust budget").

### 2. Automated Greetings Workflow
- **Trigger**: User sends "Hi" or initiates a conversation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Webhook detects a greeting message.
  2. Call GenAI to dynamically craft a personalized greeting based on user metadata or previous interactions.
  3. Include GROQ-based API responses to suggest initial property search options (e.g., trending listings).
  4. **Response**:
     - Text message: "Welcome! Based on your history, you might like properties in Uptown."
     - Include Quick Reply buttons for common searches (e.g., "Budget", "Location", "Type").

### 3. Error Handling Workflow
- **Trigger**: An error occurs during user interaction.
- **Steps**:
  1. Detect query failure or system error in processing.
  2. Use GenAI to generate an empathetic apology response.
  3. Use function-calling to recommend retry options dynamically (e.g., based on last successful action).
  4. **Response**:
     - Apology text: "Sorry, we couldn't process your request. Here's what you can do next:"
     - Suggest Quick Reply buttons for retry options (e.g., "Try again", "View trending properties").

### 4. Dynamic Suggestions Workflow
- **Trigger**: User repeatedly queries unavailable properties.
- **Steps**:
  1. Webhook detects repeated queries with no matches.
  2. Use GROQ APIs to retrieve trending properties based on recent user activity.
  3. Call GenAI to dynamically generate suggestions and context-aware recommendations (e.g., "These properties match your budget").
  4. Use function-calling to fetch enriched property details (e.g., proximity to schools or transit).
  5. **Response**:
     - Text message or carousel with trending property details.
     - Include buttons (e.g., "View property", "Contact agent").

### 5. Multilingual Interaction Workflow
- **Trigger**: User sends messages in non-default language.
- **Steps**:
  1. Detect language using **GenAI language models** or APIs.
  2. Translate user query using GROQ APIs for high accuracy.
  3. Process the query (e.g., using RAG to retrieve property details).
  4. Translate the response back to the user's language using GenAI.
  5. **Response**:
     - Provide text or carousel messages in the userâ€™s language.
     - Maintain context and conversational flow.

### 6. Chat History Analysis Workflow
- **Trigger**: Business admin requests insights or periodic system analysis.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use RAG with GROQ APIs to retrieve historical chat data and feedback.
  2. Call GenAI to analyze and summarize patterns (e.g., frequent queries, sentiment analysis).
  3. Use function-calling to generate actionable insights (e.g., "Add more properties in Downtown").
  4. Optionally, send a summary to the admin via WhatsApp.
  5. **Response**:
     - Insights as a text summary or downloadable report.
