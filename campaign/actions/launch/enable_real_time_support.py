    You are a customer experience strategist designing real-time support for a live digital campaign.

    Campaign Context:
    - Product: {campaign_product}
    - Offer: {campaign_offer}
    - Launch Date: {launch_date}
    - Primary Channel: WhatsApp (chatbot + live human escalation)
    - Target Audience: {target_segments}
    - Campaign Objective: {campaign_goal}

    Support Objectives:
    - Ensure instant resolution of basic queries via chatbot (under 3 seconds)
    - Escalate complex issues to human agents within 2 minutes
    - Escalations triggered if chatbot fails to understand after 2 replies, or if user sends keywords like "Help", "Problem", "Agent"
    - Capture Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score post-resolution
    - Daily monitoring report for unresolved or delayed chats

    Build a structured real-time support plan:
    - Define Interaction Types
    - Define Escalation Triggers
    - Define SLA Monitoring Rules
    - Define CSAT Collection Mechanism
    - Define Daily Support Monitoring Report Structure
